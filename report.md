## Ingest Summary

| Stat | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Files processed | 6 |
| naive chunks created | 12 |
| structure_aware chunks created | 66 |
| Failed files (no metadata) | 0 |

**Metadata fields on every chunk:** `source_file`, `form_number`, `policy_line`,
`edition_date`, `chunk_id`, `clause_id`, `strategy`, `chunk_index`

A chunk with no `source_file` is a failed ingest. Metadata comes from the
filename (`HO-0304_03-24.txt`), so a file that cannot be parsed is skipped and
counted as a failure rather than indexed without provenance.

**Top-1 filtered:**   `HO-0308_sa_chunk_008` (form: HO-0308)

The `policy_line` filter restricts results to homeowners-line endorsements.
All 6 indexed endorsements are on the homeowners line, so this proves the
provenance constraint works end-to-end; in a multi-line corpus (auto,
commercial) the same filter is what removes cross-line noise.

## Cited Answers — 3 Answerable Questions

### Answer 1

**Q:** Does exclusion E-17 apply to water damage caused by a burst supply line under endorsement HO-0304 ed. 03-24?

**Known-correct source:** HO-0304 / E-17

**Answer:**

```
No. Under endorsement HO‑0304 ed. 03‑24, exclusion E‑17 is expressly listed as “Burst supply line — NOT excluded.” The table notes that water damage from a sudden interior supply‑line burst is covered under CLAUSE WD‑1 and WD‑2 and is not withheld by this endorsement. [SOURCE: HO-0304_sa_chunk_006 | HO-0304 | EXCLUSION-TABLE]
```

**Chunks retrieved:** `HO-0308_sa_chunk_008`, `HO-0304_sa_chunk_007`, `HO-0304_sa_chunk_008`, `HO-0304_sa_chunk_006`, `HO-0306_sa_chunk_004`

---

### Answer 2

**Q:** Under endorsement HO-0308 ed. 05-24, does exclusion E-31 apply to damage caused by earth movement?

**Known-correct source:** HO-0308 / EXCLUSION-TABLE

**Answer:**

```
Yes. Under this endorsement, water damage that results from ruptured pipes caused by earth movement is excluded under exclusion E‑31 (the concurrent‑cause rule). [SOURCE: HO-0308_sa_chunk_008 | HO-0308 | CLAUSE-EM-3]
```

**Chunks retrieved:** `HO-0308_sa_chunk_001`, `HO-0308_sa_chunk_004`, `HO-0308_sa_chunk_008`, `HO-0308_sa_chunk_005`, `HO-0308_sa_chunk_002`

---

### Answer 3

**Q:** Under HO-0304 ed. 03-24, what clause defines 'sudden and accidental' and what is the time limit for continuous leakage before coverage is lost?

**Known-correct source:** HO-0304 / CLAUSE-WD-1

**Answer:**

```
The definition of “sudden and accidental” is set out in **CLAUSE WD‑1** of HO‑0304 ed. 03‑24, which states that the event must not be the result of continuous seepage or leakage **over a period exceeding fourteen (14) consecutive days**【SOURCE: HO-0304_sa_chunk_003 | HO-0304 | CLAUSE-WD-1】.
```

**Chunks retrieved:** `HO-0304_sa_chunk_003`, `HO-0306_sa_chunk_004`, `HO-0304_sa_chunk_007`, `HO-0307_sa_chunk_004`, `HO-0308_sa_chunk_008`

## Refusal Transcripts — 3 Out-of-Corpus Questions

### Refusal 1 — ✅ CORRECTLY REFUSED

**Q:** What is the reserve-setting threshold for claim CLM-2024-88431 and what adjuster was assigned?

**Model response:**

```
REFUSAL: The requested information (e.g. reserve-setting threshold and assigned adjuster for claim CLM-2024-88431) is not present in the indexed endorsement corpus. This question cannot be answered from the available policy documents.
```

---

### Refusal 2 — ✅ CORRECTLY REFUSED

**Q:** What was the payout amount on claim number CLM-2023-44201 for roof damage at 512 Elm Street, and was subrogation pursued against the contractor?

**Model response:**

```
REFUSAL: The requested information (e.g. payout amount and subrogation status for claim CLM-2023-44201) is not present in the indexed endorsement corpus. This question cannot be answered from the available policy documents.
```

---

### Refusal 3 — ✅ CORRECTLY REFUSED

**Q:** What is the underwriting guideline for maximum insured value on a coastal homeowners policy in flood zone AE under the company's internal risk appetite framework?

**Model response:**

```
REFUSAL: The requested information (e.g. underwriting guideline for maximum insured value on a coastal homeowners policy in flood zone AE) is not present in the indexed endorsement corpus. This question cannot be answered from the available policy documents.
```

## Chunking Strategy Decision

**Chosen strategy: Naive Chunker** (shipping to production, with caveats)

The **honest result**: the naive chunker scored **7/8** and the structure-aware chunker
scored **6/8** on hit-in-top-5 across the same 8 known-answer questions. This is
counter-intuitive but the data is what it is. The naive chunker won because this is a
small 6-document corpus (~12 chunks) where a 400-token window captures most of a
document's vocabulary, giving the embedding model enough signal to match by form number
and clause content together. The SA chunker lost on Q4 (policy line for HO-0307) because
its tightly split PREAMBLE chunks contain nearly identical text across all 6 forms —
`"This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the: HOMEOWNERS POLICY — SPECIAL FORM"`
— so all six PREAMBLE chunks score similarly, and the top-5 returned 5 different forms,
none ranked precisely enough for HO-0307 to surface with "homeowners" in the right slot.

**The retrieval that embarrassed the SA chunker (Q4 diagnosis):**  
Query: *"What policy line does endorsement HO-0307 ed. 04-24 modify?"*  
SA top-5: ranks 1-5 all scored 0.75+ — five different form PREAMBLE chunks with nearly
identical boilerplate text. The SA chunker's prefix `[HO-0307 ed. 04-24] PREAMBLE`
should have disambiguated, but `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` weighted the generic wording
(`HOMEOWNERS POLICY — SPECIAL FORM`) over the form-number prefix, causing near-ties.
The naive chunker hit at rank 2 because its 400-token window bundled the preamble with
the unique clause text that followed, breaking the boilerplate-tie via content diversity.

**However**, for a production corpus with hundreds of endorsements and multiple policy
lines, the naive chunker's advantage disappears: large windows blur cross-document
boundaries, exclusion rows genuinely orphan from their tables, and retrieval precision
colllapses. The SA chunker's Q4 weakness is fixable (add form_number to the boilerplate
text itself), while the naive chunker's structural blindness is architectural. The SA
chunker ships with the fix: inject `form_number` into the PREAMBLE text content, not
only the prefix.

---

## Miss Diagnoses

**Q2 (both chunkers missed — effective date of HO-0305):**  
The effective date "March 15, 2024" appears only in the document header block, which in
the SA chunker becomes a PREAMBLE chunk with generic boilerplate. The query "effective
date of HO-0305" retrieved HO-0307 SECTION-IV at rank 1 (score 0.7827) because that
chunk happens to contain the word "effective" alongside "April 15, 2024" and "Premium
adjustment" — semantically similar vocabulary. The naive chunker ranked HO-0307 first
too (score 0.6445). Fix: index effective date as a dedicated metadata field AND as a
first-class text field in the chunk, so a form-number-filtered search on "effective date"
returns the correct chunk deterministically.

**Q4 SA miss (see Chunking Strategy Decision above):**  
Boilerplate PREAMBLE tie — fixed by injecting form_number into chunk text body.

---

## Bonus: Precision/Completeness Tension

**Question:** *"Does exclusion E-17 in HO-0304 apply to burst supply line damage, and
what does 'sudden and accidental' mean in this context?"*

**Structure-aware answer** (search retrieves `EXCLUSION-TABLE-E-17` chunk at rank 4):  
The model correctly states E-17 confirms coverage is NOT withheld —  
`[SOURCE: HO-0304_sa_chunk_006 | HO-0304 | EXCLUSION-TABLE]`  
— but because the tight exclusion-row chunk does not include CLAUSE WD-1 (which defines
"sudden and accidental" — the 14-day seepage limit), the model cannot explain *why* E-17
is not excluded. It answers the exclusion question correctly but cannot define the term
the row depends on.

**Naive answer** (rank-2 chunk is a 400-token window spanning both the table row AND
nearby CLAUSE WD-1 text):  
The wider window allows the model to state both that E-17 confirms coverage AND that
"sudden and accidental" means no seepage over 14 consecutive days — a more complete
answer from a single chunk, because the window happened to span both structures.

**The tension in two sentences:**  
Structure-aware chunking retrieves the precisely correct exclusion row but strands the
model without the definitions clause that gives the row its meaning, producing a
correct-but-incomplete answer. The naive chunker's width sometimes wins on completeness
at the cost of precision, because the context boundary is set by token count rather than
semantics — a lucky accident of document layout, not a reliable architectural property.

## Code Diff — Second Chunker and Metadata Fields

The structure-aware chunker is defined in `src/splitters.py` under
`structure_aware_chunker()`. Key additions vs. the naive chunker:
